These are pretty simple, I was just having some fun, but here ya go.
1. A global timer with a custom name, count direction, and length (seconds)

command /timer [<string>] [<string>] [<integer>]:
	#arg-1 - Timer Name
	#arg-2 - Count direction (up or down)
	#arg-3 - Timer length
	trigger:
		execute console command "/bossbar remove 1389"
		wait 0.5 second
		execute console command "/bossbar add 1389 %arg-1%"
		wait 0.5 seconds
		execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 players @a"
		wait 0.5 seconds
		execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 max %arg-3%"
		
		if arg-2 is "up":
			execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value 0"
			loop arg-3 times:
				wait 1 second
				execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value %loop-number%"
			execute console command "/bossbar remove 1389"
		else:
			if arg-2 is "down":
				execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value %arg-3%"
				set {_i} to arg-3
				loop arg-3 times:
					execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value %{_i}%"
					remove 1 from {_i}
					wait 1 second
				execute console command "/bossbar remove 1389"
        
        
       
2. The /hand command currently in use for Digtastic

command /hand:
	trigger:
		if player's held item is air:
			broadcast "&7%player%: [nothing]"
		else:
			broadcast "&7%player%: [%held item%]"
      
      
      
3. A /broadcast command (like the one used in Digtastic - I was just intrigued on how it worked)

command /broadcast [<string>]:
	permission: op
	trigger:
		broadcast ""
		broadcast ""
		broadcast "&6&lServerName: &e%arg-1%"
		broadcast ""
		broadcast ""
    
    
    
4. A /nuke command, with options on wether to destroy blocks or not

command /nuke [<boolean>]:
	trigger:
		set {x} to x-position of player
		set {y} to y-position of player
		set {z} to z-position of player
		if arg-1 is true:
			loop 3 times:
				console command "/summon minecraft:creeper %{x}% %{y}% %{z}% {Fuse:300,ExplosionRadius:100,ignited:1,Invulnerable:1b}"
			
			broadcast "&4&lThe Nuclear Warhead Detonation sequence has activated. You have T-Minus 15 seconds until detonation."
		else:
			console command "/gamerule mobGriefing false"
			loop 3 times:
				console command "/summon minecraft:creeper %{x}% %{y}% %{z}% {Fuse:300,ExplosionRadius:100,ignited:1,Invulnerable:1b}"
			broadcast "&4&lThe Nuclear Warhead Detonation sequence has activated. You have T-Minus 15 seconds until detonation."
			wait 300 ticks
			console command "/gamerule mobGriefing true"
			
			
			
5. A custom whitelist, with a custom kick message, and seperate commands for ease-of-use

function contains(list: objects, check: object) :: boolean:
    loop {_list::*}:
        if loop-value is {_check}:
            return true
    return false

on load:
	set {whitelist::*} to "miniamobfighter"

on join:
	if contains({whitelist::*}, player) is false:
		kick player due to "&eThe server is still under developement. If you would like to join, please ask the owner (derpguy41-0996)"
		
command /whitelistadd [<player>]:
	permission: op
	trigger:
		if contains({whitelist::*}, arg-1) is false:
			add arg-1 to {whitelist::*}
			broadcast "&l%arg-1% has been added to the beta-access whitelist."
		else:
			broadcast "&l&c%arg-1% is already on the whitelist, silly!"

command /whitelistremove [<player>]:
	permission: op
	trigger:
		if contains({whitelist::*}, arg-1) is true:
			remove arg-1 from {whitelist::*}
			broadcast "&l%arg-1% has been removed from the beta-access whitelist."
		else:
			broadcast "&l&c%arg-1% isn't even on the whitelist, silly!"
			
command /whitelistlist:
	permission: op
	aliases: /wll
	trigger:
		broadcast "&lThe current players with beta-access are:"
		broadcast ""
		loop {whitelist::*}:
			broadcast {whitelist::%loop-index%}
			
			
			
6. A custom staff-chat that is linked with luckperms

on load:
	if player has permission "luckperms.group.staff":
		set {on.%player's uuid%} to false
		
command /staffchat:
	aliases: /sc, /schat
	trigger:
		if player has permission "luckperms.group.staff":
			if {on.%player's uuid%} is false:
				set {on.%player's uuid%} to true
				send "&l&2Staff-Chat enabled!" to player
			else:
				set {on.%player's uuid%} to false
				send "&l&4Staff-Chat disabled!" to player
		else:
			send "It's called &lStaff&r-Chat for a reason, y'know" to player

on chat:
	if {on.%player's uuid%} is true:
		cancel event
		loop all players:
			if loop-player has permission "luckperms.group.staff":
				send "&l&8[Staff-Chat]&r &5%player%: &r%message%" to player
				
				
				
7. Click detection for a server I'm working on (too long for it to be readable on here, just ask me for the code on discord)

8. A custom player flag system used for moderation.

command /listflags <player>:
	trigger:
		if {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*} is set:
				send "&l&8%arg-1%'s flags:" to player
				
				set {_loopnumb} to 0
				loop {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*}:
					add 1 to {_loopnumb}
					send "&8&l%{_loopnumb}%. &r%loop-value%"
			else:
				send "&8%arg-1% does not currently have any flags to list."


command /flag <player> [<string>]:
	permission: "luckperms.group.staff"
	trigger:
		if arg-2 is set:
				add arg-2 to {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*}
				send "&2Added a flag to %arg-1% for the reason: %arg-2%" to player
			else:
				add "No reason" to {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*}
				send "&2Added a flag to %arg-1% with no reason given" to player

command /unflag <player> [<string>]:
	permission: "luckperms.group.staff"
	trigger:
		if arg-2 is set:
			remove arg-2 from {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*}
			send "&2Removed the flag ""%arg-2%"" from %arg-1%."
		else:
			clear {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*}
			send "Completely cleared all flags from %arg-1%"



I have a couple more, but they are mostly minor things. If you want them, or want to ask any questions - or give me dev (; - DM me on Discord (derpguy41#0996)
