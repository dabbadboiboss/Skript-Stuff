These are pretty simple, I was just having some fun, but here ya go.
1. A global timer with a custom name, count direction, and length (seconds)

command /timer [<string>] [<string>] [<integer>]:
	#arg-1 - Timer Name
	#arg-2 - Count direction (up or down)
	#arg-3 - Timer length
	trigger:
		execute console command "/bossbar remove 1389"
		wait 0.5 second
		execute console command "/bossbar add 1389 %arg-1%"
		wait 0.5 seconds
		execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 players @a"
		wait 0.5 seconds
		execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 max %arg-3%"
		
		if arg-2 is "up":
			execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value 0"
			loop arg-3 times:
				wait 1 second
				execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value %loop-number%"
			execute console command "/bossbar remove 1389"
		else:
			if arg-2 is "down":
				execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value %arg-3%"
				set {_i} to arg-3
				loop arg-3 times:
					execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value %{_i}%"
					remove 1 from {_i}
					wait 1 second
				execute console command "/bossbar remove 1389"
        
        
       
2. The /hand command currently in use for Digtastic

command /hand:
	trigger:
		if player's held item is air:
			broadcast "&7%player%: [nothing]"
		else:
			broadcast "&7%player%: [%held item%]"
      
      
      
3. A /broadcast command (like the one used in Digtastic - I was just intrigued on how it worked)

command /broadcast [<string>]:
	permission: op
	trigger:
		broadcast ""
		broadcast ""
		broadcast "&6&lServerName: &e%arg-1%"
		broadcast ""
		broadcast ""
    
    
    
4. A /nuke command, with options on wether to destroy blocks or not

command /nuke [<boolean>]:
	trigger:
		set {x} to x-position of player
		set {y} to y-position of player
		set {z} to z-position of player
		if arg-1 is true:
			loop 3 times:
				console command "/summon minecraft:creeper %{x}% %{y}% %{z}% {Fuse:300,ExplosionRadius:100,ignited:1,Invulnerable:1b}"
			
			broadcast "&4&lThe Nuclear Warhead Detonation sequence has activated. You have T-Minus 15 seconds until detonation."
		else:
			console command "/gamerule mobGriefing false"
			loop 3 times:
				console command "/summon minecraft:creeper %{x}% %{y}% %{z}% {Fuse:300,ExplosionRadius:100,ignited:1,Invulnerable:1b}"
			broadcast "&4&lThe Nuclear Warhead Detonation sequence has activated. You have T-Minus 15 seconds until detonation."
			wait 300 ticks
			console command "/gamerule mobGriefing true"
			
			
			
5. A custom whitelist, with a custom kick message, and seperate commands for ease-of-use

function contains(list: objects, check: object) :: boolean:
    loop {_list::*}:
        if loop-value is {_check}:
            return true
    return false

on load:
	set {whitelist::*} to "miniamobfighter"

on join:
	if contains({whitelist::*}, player) is false:
		kick player due to "&eThe server is still under developement. If you would like to join, please ask the owner (derpguy41-0996)"
		
command /whitelistadd [<player>]:
	permission: op
	trigger:
		if contains({whitelist::*}, arg-1) is false:
			add arg-1 to {whitelist::*}
			broadcast "&l%arg-1% has been added to the beta-access whitelist."
		else:
			broadcast "&l&c%arg-1% is already on the whitelist, silly!"

command /whitelistremove [<player>]:
	permission: op
	trigger:
		if contains({whitelist::*}, arg-1) is true:
			remove arg-1 from {whitelist::*}
			broadcast "&l%arg-1% has been removed from the beta-access whitelist."
		else:
			broadcast "&l&c%arg-1% isn't even on the whitelist, silly!"
			
command /whitelistlist:
	permission: op
	aliases: /wll
	trigger:
		broadcast "&lThe current players with beta-access are:"
		broadcast ""
		loop {whitelist::*}:
			broadcast {whitelist::%loop-index%}
			
			
			
6. A custom staff-chat that is linked with luckperms

on load:
	if player has permission "luckperms.group.staff":
		set {on.%player's uuid%} to false
		
command /staffchat:
	aliases: /sc, /schat
	trigger:
		if player has permission "luckperms.group.staff":
			if {on.%player's uuid%} is false:
				set {on.%player's uuid%} to true
				send "&l&2Staff-Chat enabled!" to player
			else:
				set {on.%player's uuid%} to false
				send "&l&4Staff-Chat disabled!" to player
		else:
			send "It's called &lStaff&r-Chat for a reason, y'know" to player

on chat:
	if {on.%player's uuid%} is true:
		cancel event
		loop all players:
			if loop-player has permission "luckperms.group.staff":
				send "&l&8[Staff-Chat]&r &5%player%: &r%message%" to player
				
				
				
7. Click detection for a server I'm working on (too long for it to be readable on here, just ask me for the code on discord)

function money(p: player, s: int):
	set line 5 of {_p}'s scoreboard to "&aMoney: %{_s}%"
	add {_s} * {moneymult::%{_p}'s uuid%} to {_p}'s money

function item(p: player, i: string, a: int):
	console command "/give %{_p}% %{_i}% %{_a}%"

on first join:
	set {moneymult::%player's uuid%} to 1
	

on right click:

	#Spawn area (1)
	if clicked block is Light Blue Concrete:
		money(player, 1)
	else if clicked block is Grass Block:
		money(player, 1)
	
	#Plains area (2)
	if clicked block is Cobblestone:
		money(player, 2)
	else if clicked block is Oak Log:
		money(player, 2)
	else if clicked block is Oak Stairs:
		money(player, 2)
	else if clicked block is Oak Planks:
		money(player, 2)
	else if clicked block is Hay bale:
		money(player, 2)
	else if clicked block is Emerald Ore:
		item(player, "Emerald", 1)
		
	#Clouds area (2.5)
	
	if clicked block is White Concrete:
		money(player, 3)
	else if clicked block is White Wool:
		money(player, 3)
	else if clicked block is White Carpet:
		money(player, 3)
	else if clicked block is Spruce Wood:
		item(player, "Spruce_Wood", 1)
		
	#Desert area (3)
	
	if clicked block is Sandstone:
		money(player, 4)
	else if clicked block is Sand:
		money(player, 4)
	else if clicked block is Sandstone Slab:
		money(player, 4)
	else if clicked block is Terracotta:
		money(player, 4)
	else if clicked block is Cut Sandstone:
		money(player, 4)
	else if clicked block is Smooth Sandstone:
		money(player, 4)
	else if clicked block is Cactus:
		money(player, 4)
	else if clicked block is Dead Bush:
		money(player, 4)
		
	#Snow Tunnel Area (3.5)
	
	if clicked block is Snow Layer:
		money(player, 5)
	else if clicked block is Snow Block:
		money(player, 5)
	else if clicked block is Powder Snow:
		money(player, 5)
		
	#Snow Area (4)
	
	if clicked block is Packed ice:
		money(player, 7)
	else if clicked block is Ice:
		money(player, 7)
	else if clicked block is Blue Ice:
		money(player, 7)
		
	#Nether (2-1)
	
	if clicked block is Netherrack:
		money(player, 10)
	else if clicked block is Weeping Vines:
		money(player, 10)
		
	#Nether Parkour (2-1.5
	
	#N/A
	
	#End
	
	if clicked block is Black Concrete:
		money(player, 25)
	else if clicked block is End stone:
		money(player, 25)
	else if clicked block is End stone Bricks:
		money(player, 25)
	else if clicked block is End stone Brick Stairs:
		money(player, 25)
	else if clicked block is End stone Brick Slab:
		money(player, 25)
	else if clicked block is Obsidian:
		item(player, "Obsidian", 1)

8. A custom player flag system used for moderation.

command /listflags <player>:
	trigger:
		if {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*} is set:
				send "&l&8%arg-1%'s flags:" to player
				
				set {_loopnumb} to 0
				loop {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*}:
					add 1 to {_loopnumb}
					send "&8&l%{_loopnumb}%. &r%loop-value%"
			else:
				send "&8%arg-1% does not currently have any flags to list."


command /flag <player> [<string>]:
	permission: "luckperms.group.staff"
	trigger:
		if arg-2 is set:
				add arg-2 to {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*}
				send "&2Added a flag to %arg-1% for the reason: %arg-2%" to player
			else:
				add "No reason" to {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*}
				send "&2Added a flag to %arg-1% with no reason given" to player

command /unflag <player> [<string>]:
	permission: "luckperms.group.staff"
	trigger:
		if arg-2 is set:
			remove arg-2 from {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*}
			send "&2Removed the flag ""%arg-2%"" from %arg-1%."
		else:
			clear {flags::%arg-1's uuid%::*}
			send "Completely cleared all flags from %arg-1%"



9. A karma system. (using another skript) every time you hit a pig, it lowers your karma

on first join:
	set {karma::%player's uuid%} to 0

command /karma <player>:
	trigger:
		send "%arg-1% has %{karma::%arg-1's uuid%}% karma. &7Tip: &oDon't displease the Lord, or bad things might happen..."

command /setkarma <player> <integer>:
	permission: op
	trigger:
		set {karma::%arg-1's uuid%} to arg-2
		send "&2Set %arg-1%'s karma to %arg-2%!"

command /sacrifice:
	aliases: /resetkarma
	trigger:
		if display name of player's held item is "&2&lSuper-Compressed Emerald":
			remove 1 of tool from player's held item
			if {karmaenabled::%player's uuid%} is false:
				send "Nice! Your karma has been reset, and you have been released from Hell!"
				set {karma::%player's uuid%} to 0
				console command "/tp %player% -167.5 105 142.5"
			else:
				send "Nice! Your karma has been reset!"
				set {karma::%player's uuid%} to 0
		else:
			send "You need to hold a Super-Compressed Emerald to reset your karma!"

command /gotohell <player>:
	aliases: /hell
	permission: op
	trigger:
		send "&c&l%player% just sent you to hell!" to arg-1
		console command "/tp %arg-1% -130.5 148 240.5"

on any movement:

	if {karmaenabled::%player's uuid%} is true:
		#first karma stage
		if {karma::%player's uuid%} is between -100 and -1:
			set {_random} to a random integer between 1 and 10000
			if {_random} is 1:
				strike lightning effect at player
				damage player by 2 hearts
				send "&cGod dislikes anyone with low karma. Don't be a bad person!" to player
		
		#second karma stage
		if {karma::%player's uuid%} is between -101 and -200:
			set {_random} to a random integer between 1 and 1000
			if {_random} is 1:
				strike lightning effect at player
				damage player by 3 hearts
				send "&cGod is becoming angry about your ever-lowering karma. It isn't too late!" to player
		
		#third karma stage
		if {karma::%player's uuid%} is between -201 and 300:
			set {_random} to a random integer between 1 and 500
			if {_random} is 1:
				strike lightning effect at player
				damage player by 4 hearts
				send "&cThe only way to gain karma is to sacrifice &r&2&lSuper-Compressed Emerald &r&c to God using /sacrifice. If your karma lowers below -400, you will be sent to &4&lHell." to player
		
		#final karma stage
		if {karma::%player's uuid%} is less than -400:
			set {karmaenabled::%player's uuid%} to false
			send "That's it. I'm fed up with you and your sins. &4&lGO TO HELL!" to player
			console command "/tp %player% -130.5 148 240.5"





I have a couple more, but they are mostly minor things. If you want them, or want to ask any questions - or give me dev (; - DM me on Discord (derpguy41#0996)
