These are pretty simple, I was just having some fun, but here ya go.
1. A global timer with a custom name, count direction, and length (seconds)

command /timer [<string>] [<string>] [<integer>]:
	#arg-1 - Timer Name
	#arg-2 - Count direction (up or down)
	#arg-3 - Timer length
	trigger:
		execute console command "/bossbar remove 1389"
		wait 0.5 second
		execute console command "/bossbar add 1389 %arg-1%"
		wait 0.5 seconds
		execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 players @a"
		wait 0.5 seconds
		execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 max %arg-3%"
		
		if arg-2 is "up":
			execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value 0"
			loop arg-3 times:
				wait 1 second
				execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value %loop-number%"
			execute console command "/bossbar remove 1389"
		else:
			if arg-2 is "down":
				execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value %arg-3%"
				set {_i} to arg-3
				loop arg-3 times:
					execute console command "/bossbar set 1389 value %{_i}%"
					remove 1 from {_i}
					wait 1 second
				execute console command "/bossbar remove 1389"
        
        
       
2. The /hand command currently in use for Digtastic

command /hand:
	trigger:
		if player's held item is air:
			broadcast "&7%player%: [nothing]"
		else:
			broadcast "&7%player%: [%held item%]"
      
      
      
3. A /broadcast command (like the one used in Digtastic - I was intrigued on how it worked)

command /broadcast [<string>]:
	permission: op
	trigger:
		broadcast ""
		broadcast ""
		broadcast "&6&lServerName: &e%arg-1%"
		broadcast ""
		broadcast ""
    
    
    
4. A /nuke command, with options on wether to destroy blocks or not

command /nuke [<boolean>]:
	trigger:
		set {x} to x-position of player
		set {y} to y-position of player
		set {z} to z-position of player
		if arg-1 is true:
			loop 3 times:
				console command "/summon minecraft:creeper %{x}% %{y}% %{z}% {Fuse:300,ExplosionRadius:100,ignited:1,Invulnerable:1b}"
			
			broadcast "&4&lThe Nuclear Warhead Detonation sequence has activated. You have T-Minus 15 seconds until detonation."
		else:
			console command "/gamerule mobGriefing false"
			loop 3 times:
				console command "/summon minecraft:creeper %{x}% %{y}% %{z}% {Fuse:300,ExplosionRadius:100,ignited:1,Invulnerable:1b}"
			broadcast "&4&lThe Nuclear Warhead Detonation sequence has activated. You have T-Minus 15 seconds until detonation."
			wait 300 ticks
			console command "/gamerule mobGriefing true"
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
If you want the rest of them, just ask or DM me on discord (derpguy41#0996)
